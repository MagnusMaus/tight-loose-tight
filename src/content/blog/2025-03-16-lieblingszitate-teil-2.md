Hier wie versprochen Pt. 2 meiner liebsten Zitate zu Strategie, Systemik und Unternehmertum (inkl. Bonus-Zitat von Steve Jobs!) zum Jahresende ðŸ’¬:  
  
#13 "The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do."  
Michael Porter  
  
#14 "A system is never the sum of its parts; itâ€™s the product of their interaction."  
Russell Ackoff  
  
#15 "The performance of a system doesnâ€™t depend on how the parts perform taken separately, it depends on how they perform together â€“ how they interact, not on how they act, taken separately. Therefore, when you improve the performance of a part of a system taken separately, you can destroy the system."  
Russell Ackoff  
  
#16 "Strategy is a pattern in a stream of decisions."  
Henry Mintzberg  
  
#17 "The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing."  
Stephen Covey  
  
#18 "A problem well stated is a problem half solved."  
Charles Kettering  
  
#19 "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."  
Margaret Mead  
  
#20 "The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence; it is to act with yesterday's logic."  
Peter Drucker  
  
#21 "Today's problems come from yesterday's solutions."  
Peter Senge  
  
#22 "The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that's changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking any risks."  
Mark Zuckerberg  
  
#23 "You don't learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over."  
Richard Branson  
  
#24 "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently."  
Henry Ford  
  
BONUS: "The ones who think they are crazy enough to change the world are the ones who do." Steve Jobs
