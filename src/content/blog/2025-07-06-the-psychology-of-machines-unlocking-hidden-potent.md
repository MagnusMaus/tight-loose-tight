The psychology of machines: Unlocking hidden potential through coaching 𝐟𝐨𝐫 AI.


Time and time again I read of AI supporting or even replacing Coaches.

𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐈?

I'm currently vibecoding an app. One that has been a very concrete idea for years, but logistics and cost were too high to make the move.

Now with AI support? 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞.


During a session this morning I was stuck deep in the mud. The AI (Gemini 2.5) was in an error loop. Producing the same faulty code again and again. Nothing budged.

With every failed attempt, Gemini added apologies, trying harder to undo the last critical build errors. At some point focusing on single lines - and lamenting on why it shouldn't have happened and how sorry it was. 

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦-𝐟𝐨𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐝. 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠.

"I failed you repeatedly, although I should have known better." 

"I focus now on fixing what I shouldn't have done. I am utterly sorry."


But did it solve the problem? No. ❌️

A classic example of fear of failure instead of hope for success.
Focused on correcting past mistakes, losing sight of the bigger picture.


That reminded me of something Dominic von Proeck Sr. from Leaders of AI taught us in my Hashtag#MBAI course: how very human AI can act. 

How helpful it is to give it an emotional anchor and to support it with proper leadership – in this case, through coaching.

"𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚 𝐝𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐛𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐞." – The effectiveness of this is study-proven.

So I gave it a shot:

"Take a deep breath before you continue. You are a very knowledgeable software engineer, I'm sure you are able to fix this. Since you're an expert on this domain, you are not bound to the given solution. Take a step back, that will help."


𝐀𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐢𝐝.

Immediately after this prompt, Gemini fixed the code. And made the architecture way more robust in one sweep.

This shows what Dominic von Proeck Sr. so often says and what studies show: The ability to lead will (still) be one of the most valuable skills in the future.

𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐬𝐨 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐰𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐛𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞, 𝐰𝐞 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐩𝐬𝐲𝐜𝐡𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐥𝐲.


My next step? Write a coach for my coding partner. So I can focus on what really matters to me. 

The outcome. 
𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞.
